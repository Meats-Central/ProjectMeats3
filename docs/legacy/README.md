# Legacy Deployment Documentation

This folder contains the previous deployment documentation that has been replaced by the streamlined `USER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` in the repository root.

## Files in this folder:
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - The original comprehensive deployment guide (very detailed but overwhelming)
- `QUICK_SETUP.md` - The original quick setup guide (focused on troubleshooting)
- `production_checklist.md` - The original production checklist (very long format)

## Current Documentation:
**Please use [`USER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](../USER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) instead** - it's a streamlined, tested, 30-minute deployment guide.

## Why these files were archived:
- **Documentation fragmentation** - Multiple overlapping guides caused confusion
- **Complexity** - The guides were very detailed but overwhelming for new users
- **Inconsistency** - Different approaches and references across different files

The new `USER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` consolidates the best parts of all these guides into a simple, step-by-step checklist format that gets you deployed in under 30 minutes.

## Legacy Content Value:
These files are preserved because they contain detailed explanations and alternative approaches that may be useful for:
- Advanced deployment scenarios
- Troubleshooting complex issues
- Understanding the complete deployment ecosystem
- Historical reference

If you need more detailed information than provided in the main guide, you can reference these files, but the main guide should handle 99% of deployment scenarios.
