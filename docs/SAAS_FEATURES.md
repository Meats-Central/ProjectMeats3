# ProjectMeats3 SaaS Features Guide

ProjectMeats3 has been enhanced with comprehensive SaaS capabilities, transforming it from a single-tenant application to a multi-tenant platform with subscription management, customization, and licensing controls.

## üèóÔ∏è Multi-Tenancy Architecture

### Tenant Isolation
- **Shared Database**: All tenants share the same database with tenant-scoped data
- **Tenant Model**: Central tenant management with subdomain support
- **Data Isolation**: All business entities (suppliers, customers, orders) are tenant-scoped
- **User Management**: Users belong to specific tenants with role-based access

### Tenant Features
- Unique subdomains (e.g., `acme.projectmeats.com`)
- Custom branding and theming per tenant
- Isolated data and user access
- Usage tracking and limits enforcement

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration System

### Tenant Configuration
Each tenant has a comprehensive configuration system supporting:

- **Theme Configuration**: Colors, fonts, logos, custom CSS
- **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable features per tenant
- **Business Settings**: Currency, timezone, company info, payment terms

### API Endpoints
